# HOW-I-REVERSED-MY-AGING-

Am in my 50s but I have energy and stamina of someone who is a decade younger . I can play football and I can also run 10km marathon at rate of 10.19 minutes per 34km/hr.


The key to reversal of my aging is activation of a gene called sirtuins , descendants of an ancient survival circuit that, is both the cause of aging and the key to reversing it. Sirtuins can be switched on both by lifestyle changes such as intermittent fasting, as well as by consuming ingestibles that boost NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a chemical that's central to how the metabolism functions. 

Am absurdly looking boyish ,brimed with energy . my face is unlined , I have full head of hair, none of it gray. And if you measure my blood biochemistry, which I do maybe four times a year, I'm definitely getting younger.



To stay younger and healthier , I followed my doctor's recommendations and there are a host of science-backed lifestyle changes I made: eat less, exercise regularly, stay away from cigarettes, and get enough sleep. I eat mostly plant based diet. I do take supplement like resveratrol to reduce my blood sugar level  and inflammation.
